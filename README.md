# quick_screenshot
simple program that makes taking custom area screenshots
quicker
This only works on Linux since it relies on pyxhook rather
than pyhook.

while program is running, double-click anywhere on the  
screen and without releasing second click, drag the mouse to 
another location and release the button. 
A square is formed from the two corners and a screenshot
of that area of the screen is saved to the folder specified
in the command line argument 
This is a command line tool currently ran from the main
folder only with '>python screenshot.py name_of_folder'
